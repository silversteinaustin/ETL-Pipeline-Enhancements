# Crowdfunding_ETL
This project demonstrates a streamlined approach to data sanitation through the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, enabling the efficient integration of data into a database. The repository is organized into two main directories: ETL_Files, which houses all necessary scripts and resources for executing the ETL process, and Resources, containing the raw CSV files utilized in the project.

Leveraging Python, alongside Pandas library and Python dictionary methods, the raw data is meticulously extracted and transformed within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The project utilizes four CSV files as the foundation for constructing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and developing a comprehensive table schema. Subsequently, the processed data is seamlessly uploaded into a PostgreSQL database, showcasing a practical application of database management and data integration techniques.
